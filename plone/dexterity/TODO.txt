Dexterity To-Do List
====================

 General
 -------
 
    - Create a buildout with:
        - plone.alterego
        - plone.behavior
        - plone.folder
        - plone.supermodel
        - plone.dexterity

 plone.supermodel
 ----------------
 
    - Support for widget hints for z3c.forms

 plone.dexterity
 ---------------
 
    - Rectify atrocious lack of tests
        - want to use `mocker` proxies for most tests
        - end-to-end integration tests for each type (see examples below)
 
    - FTI needs to provide view, edit actions as standard
    - FTI needs to provide view, edit, default view aliases as standard
 
    - Factory needs to initialise instance security based on schema
    - Add view needs to be protected by fti.add_permission dynamically
    
    - Support type and FTI migration
    - Support runtime schema changes (including fields removed and changed)
 
    - Use widget hints from plone.supermodel in add and edit forms
    - Support fields from behaviors in add/edit forms
    
    - Need to cache model/schema more effectively
 
    - Flesh out examples and possibly add convenience APIs for:
        - Type installed with GS, no filesystem component
        - Type installed with GS, filesystem interface
        - Type installed with GS, filesystem interface and type class
        - Type installed with GS, filesystem interface, type class and views
 
 plone.app.dexterity
 -------------------
 
    - Better views for IDexterityItem and IDexterityContainer
    - Provide optional standard Ploneish metadata fieldsets for add/edit forms
    - Make content types support title-to-id, perhaps via behaviors
    
    - UI for building schemata
    - UI for view customisation
    
 Integration concerns
 --------------------
 
    - Need a reference engine (plone.app.relations)
    - Need working versioning with version-on-save (CMFEditions policy)
    - Need working content staging (iterate needs to stop using AT references)
    - Need working link integrity (ditto for plone.linkintegrity)
    - Need inline validation of z3c.form forms
