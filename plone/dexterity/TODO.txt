Dexterity To-Do List
====================

 Areas that need ownership
 -------------------------
 
    [ ] Schema composition and fieldsets in forms, integration with 
        plone.behavior
    
    [ ] Field-level security
    
    [ ] i18n support in schema
    
    [ ] Schema editor and Plone control panel
    
    [ ] Reference engine integration
    
    [ ] Versioning integration

 plone.dexterity
 ---------------
  
    General
    ~~~~~~~
  
    [-] Flesh out examples and possibly add convenience APIs for:
        [x] Type installed with GS, no filesystem component
        [x] Type installed with GS, filesystem interface
        [ ] Type installed with GS, filesystem interface and views
        [ ] Type installed with GS, filesystem interface and type class
  
    Schema and FTI
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    [*] The xml_schema() pattern is tricky, because the CA is not yet loaded
        by the time the ZCML parser tries to import the module.
        
    [*] Factory needs to initialise instance security based on schema

    [ ] Support for multiple schemata is only partially worked out. For
        example, the sync on FTI modified and the factory code only use
        the default schema.

    [ ] Consider whether we want to be able to look up schema by adapter,
        rather than asking the FTI directly.
        - May be more useful to have a separate concept of a composite schema
          since a schema provided by the type implies attribute access and a
          "flat" namespace.
        - Schema probably needs to be closely tied to model and FTI in almost
          all cases.
      
    [ ] Need to handle case where portal is renamed and/or FTI is renamed.
        In both cases, the prefix+portal type name encoded in the schema name 
        may cause problems. Ergo, we probably want a better way to map a named
        schema (which may not exist yet) to an actual FTI instance for looking
        up the model.
      
        - perhaps we can keep "ghost FTI" utilities around until a new one
          is registered for the same name?
        
    Views
    ~~~~~
 
    [*] Add, edit forms need better buttons
    
    [*] Edit form should go to view after save
 
    [*] Use 'widget' model metadata in forms
    
    [*] Support fieldsets and externalised field ordering in add/edit forms
    
    [*] Support fields from behaviors in add/edit forms
    
    Misc
    ~~~~
    
    [ ] Need to properly support i18n in model file
    
    [ ] Provide support for various types of migration when FTIs change, e.g.
        swapping from one FTI to another or changing a model significantly.
     
 plone.app.dexterity
 -------------------
 
    [ ] Better views for IDexterityItem and IDexterityContainer
    [ ] Provide optional standard Ploneish metadata fieldsets for add/edit 
        forms (should be implemented as a behaviour)
    [ ] Make content types support title-to-id (again, should be a behaviour)
    
    [ ] UI for managing types, importing, exporting etc.
    [ ] UI for building schemata
    [ ] UI for view customisation
        - Write out a "flat" template that includes all current fields
        - Register with portal_view_customizations
    
 Integration concerns
 --------------------
 
    - Need a reference engine, widget (plone.app.relations - fields/widgets)
    - Need versioning with version-on-save (CMFEditions policy - behavior)
    - Need content staging (iterate w/o AT references - behavior)
    - Need link integrity (linkintegrity w/o AT references - behavior)
    - Need inline validation (have this for formlib, not z3c.form)
    - Need inline editing (have this for formlib, not z3c.form)
